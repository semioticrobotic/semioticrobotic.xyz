# Isaac Asimov's Science Fiction Magazine
A collection, an archive, a record  
Last updated: 2020.10.04

## Volume 3, Issue 9 (September 1979)

### Novella

#### "Enemy Mine" by Barry B. Longyear
Two bitter enemy soldiers crash land on a deserted planet and form an unlikely friendship as they learn to speak, grow, and survive together; understanding why one of my favorite *Asimov's* stories won Hugo, Locus, and Nebula awards in 1980 is not difficult whatsoever.

## Volume 6, Issue 5 (May 1982)

### Departments

#### Editorial: "Farewell to George" by Isaac Asimov
Asimov bids farewell to George Scithers, first editor of Asimov's, in a heartfelt account of Scithers' pivotal role in the magazine's success.

### Short Stories

#### "The Engineer of Beasts" by Scott Sanders
A precocious young girl is made apprentice of an ex-taxidermist whose new job is producing mechanical animals for amusement park ("disneys" has become the synonym for such parks) rides after his society is encapsulated permanently under a biodome.

#### "Co-Existence" by David Brin
In a world with multiple simultaneous time streams, humankind must learn to discard previously sacred laws of physics, govern itself in multiple temporalities, and barter between societies living in different timespaces; a science fiction writer is tapped to solve the mystery of bodies seemingly trapped in slow motion.

#### "Earthscape" by Robert F. Young
A colonist who spends ten Earth years on Mars returns to claim the civil service job that should be rightfully his, but he gradually realizes that he feels alienated from native friends an families; the story reminds me of my return from graduate school in Maine (the sense of alienation and longing is so palpable here), but if this is the case, has the extrapolation really achieved all it can?

## Volume 6, Issue 12 (December 1982)

### Departments

#### "Up Front" by Kathleen Moloney
An introduction to this special issue featuring the first two chapters of the soon-to-be-released Foundation's Edge, which thanks The Good Doctor for allowing the celebration; the special occasion is a cause for temporarily abandoning the magazine's typical structure.

#### Editorial: "Susan Calvin" by Isaac Asimov
Asimov relates the tale of his naming the eponymous heroine of the robot stories and novels, revealing that he derived the name from that of a treasured graduate mentor.

#### Viewpoint: "The Story Behind the 'Foundation'" by Isaac Asimov
Asimov reflects on the journey of the original Foundation trilogy from short story manuscripts to published trilogy; when speaking about the newest installment, he admits that his publisher basically coerced him into writing it.

### Short Stories

#### "Cutting Down" by Bob Shaw
A magazine journalist steals experimental medication to help his obese wife lose weight and regain her once-attractive figure.

#### "Destroyer City" by Dennis Takesako
In a beautifully rendered automated city to which "criminals" are banished from a society that has outlawed capital punishment, two fugitives struggle to survive an architectural killing machine.

#### "Our Revels Now are Ended" by James Corrick
An experimental colony votes to abandon its duty as humankind's last hope for life in the galaxy and return home to a dying planet Earth; the captain of the expedition has a different agenda.

### Novella

#### "Foundation's Edge" by Isaac Asimov
The magazine prints the first two chapters of the forthcoming novel, the first new Foundation novel in 32 years; interspersed throughout the chapters are notes of reflection and congratulations from preeminent science fiction authors, including Arthur C. Clarke, Gregory Benford, and Clifford D. Simack.

### Poetry

#### "Ancient Document" by Hope Athearn
It's a poem; I didn't get it.

### Letters
Readers are upset with Asimov's June 1982 editorial regarding the evolutionism/creationism debate; another reader just hates the June 1982 cover; readers weigh in on a particularly divisive story from May 1982, "All the Time in the World."

## Volume 6, Issue 13 (Mid-December 1982)

### Departments

#### "Up Front" by Kathleen Moloney
Moloney establishes the context for the"dueling" essays on violence and war: one by Asimov (in his regular column) and one by Charles Platt (his profile of Jerry Pournelle).

#### Editorial: "On Violence" by Isaac Asimov
Asimov defends his assertion that "violence is the last refuge of the incompetent," a statement Jerry Pournelle mocks when interviewed later in the issue; here Asimov highlights the fact that his novels contain little, if any, violence (and that such violence, if necessary to the plot, often happens offstage).

#### Profile: "Jerry Pournelle" by Charles Platt
Platt renders Pournelle as a seemingly contradictory figure: a stringent libertarian with whom militarism and the prospect of autocracy sit just fine.

### Short Stories

#### "The Protector" by Art Vesity
Disembodied voices insist that a young schizophrenic must protect the population from aliens secretly infiltrating a city's female population; when he locates a genuine alien, however, his entire psyche short-circuits.

#### "The Mysterious Cure" by J. O. Jeppson
A group of psychologists gather for lunch and a discussion of a patient they realize they've all attempted to treat for hallucinations; the science is completely slipshod in this story, which is more remarkable for the telling than the thing told.

### Poetry

#### "Syrup" by Steve Rasnic Tem
A poem that opened itself only after a second reading; Tem revels in a certain image of the irreducible materiality that subtends and in-forms all things human, nonhuman, alien, and inorganic.

## Volume 9, Issue 5 (May 1985)

### Departments

#### Editorial: "Moonshine" by Isaac Asimov
Asimov discusses the role of the moon in popular consciousness and science fiction literature.

#### Viewpoint: "The Little Tin God of Characterization" by Isaac Asimov
Asimov responds to criticisms that his writing includes only "flat" characters with an editorial reminding readers that the hallmark of science fiction is ideas, not characters.

### Short Stories

#### "The War at Home" by Lewis Shiner
A two-page story written as a collage; the narrator seems haunted by memories of war in which he did not fight, but nevertheless feels compelled to relive.

#### "Preliminary Notes on the Jang" by Lisa Goldstein
A graduate student in anthropology discovers members of a seemingly ancient society tucked in a New York apartment; after he realizes they worship the god of trickery, he questions the nature of knowledge produced by his fieldwork.

#### "Sea Changes" by Marta Randall
The narrator finds herself exiled on a strange planet while hunting and trapping; when a amnesiac stranger washes up on shore, she undergoes an odd but beautifully described metamorphosis that discloses the planet's strange designs.

#### "Anyone Here from Utah?" by Michael Swanwick
A bar patron tries to convince his interlocutor, the narrator, that multinational corporations, the military-industrial complex, and world governments are using television to keep citizens completely immersed in an alternate reality that contorts their sense of place.

## Volume 15, Issue 2 (February 1991)

### Departments

#### Editorial: "Gorbachev" by Isaac Asimov
Asimov relays the story of his visit to the Soviet Embassy in Washington, but this tale is filled with an inordinate amount of minutiae and irrelevant detail; Asimov seemed to have a pleasant trip, but the story of said trip wasn't very pleasant at all.

### Short Stories

#### "Bright Light, Big City" by Greg Costikyan
In a most uninteresting stream-of-consciousness, the narrator recalls his flight from New York City to Philadelphia, which he undertakes after learning terrorists are holding part of the city hostage under threat of nuclear detonation; readers should be thankful Costikyan gave up writing poorly-paced, unimaginative science fiction to become a game designer.

#### "The SF Writer's Lament" by Joe Haldeman
In this song, a woebegone editor of a science fiction magazine laments the predictable and derivative fiction that lands on his desk monthly; in the end, he scatters it all across the floor and recombines manuscripts to produce more interesting fare.

#### "Letters from Sarah" by Don Webb
A housewife transplanted in a tribal community attends a religious ceremony, only to be stricken with a condition that sparks reverse evolution.

### Novelettes

#### "The Better Boy" by James P. Blaylock and Time Powers
A humble farmer is convinced he can bend light to produce miraculous effects that will protect his prize-winning tomato from destruction by insects.

#### "Hummers" by Lisa Mason
In her last days, a cancer patient finds peace in the winged friends that visit her newly-installed feeder; but the birds portend grisly events.

#### "Under Old New York" by Neal Barrett, Jr.
In a post-apocalyptic New York, a homeless woman looks for work in a mysterious district that seems to be prospering; race and class intersect in a conclusion that is somewhat perplexing, even on multiple reads.

#### "The Happy Man" by Jonathan Lethem
Lethem's piece, a gripping narrative about a lost soul that travels to and from Hell against its will, is the highlight of this issue; part family drama, part horror story, part speculation on the nature of hell, it's one that doesn't easily let go.

## Volume 19, Issue 1 (January 1995)

### Novelettes

#### "Waging Good" by Robert Reed
A group of friends reunites after one of them returns from years spent as a nurse on post-nuclear Earth; told *in media res*, this revenge narrative unfolds just perfectly, dropping backstory at times most opportune for keeping readers on edge.

#### "And I Must Baffle Before the Hint" by L. Timmel Duchamp
Thirteen-year-olds inexplicably sprout spinnerets and begin weaving themselves into cocoons; it's a fantastically-written story about the relationship between change and fear.

### Short Stories

#### "The Invisible Woman" by Thomas M. Disch
A woman to whom no one pays any attention suddenly becomes (literally) invisible; the atmosphere this story generates certainly compensates for its lackluster ending.

#### "Sitcom" by Lewis Shiner
In the best story of the issue, an aging husband struggles to connect with his much-younger wife over a television show that's embedded in an entire generation's popular consciousness—but may have never existed.

#### "Long Term Project: Report to the Great Council of Cockroaches (Or, What Really Happened to the Dinosaurs)" by Geoffrey A. Landis
The story's brilliance is in its brevity; in little more than one-hundred words and a fun, quasi-bureautic voice, it posits a theory of cockroach survival.

## Volume 20, Issue 4 (April 1996)

### Departments

#### "Reflections: Extinct Again" by Robert Silverberg
Silverberg pens a pre-emptive eulogy for the coelacanth, a species of fish native to an unbelievably small area of the Indian ocean; the fish species is gradually on its way to extinction, and no one can save it.

#### "Letters from Isaac Asimov" by Stanley Asimov
Asimov presents a few of his brothers letters, which he's just finished compiling for the collection *Yours, Isaac Asimov*.

### Novella

#### "Human History" by Lucius Shepard
A neo-Western society of a far-flung, war-torn future has no memory of its past, yet considerable bloodshed reveals more than perhaps any member wishes to know; at more than 80 pages, this is one of the longest stories I've encountered in Asimov's, but it is also an all-time favorite.

### Short Stories

#### "The Soul Selects Her Own Society: Invasion and Repulsion: A Chronological Reinterpretation of Two of Emily Dickenson's Poems: A Wellsian Perspective" by Connie Willis
Written as a *faux* academic publication, the piece claims that Dickenson encountered the martians of *War of the Worlds.*

#### "Early, in the Evening" by Ian Watson
Time is perpetually looping back on itself, and a beleaguered society must relive hundreds of years every single day; this story was the highlight of the issue.

#### "Mortal Clay" by S. N. Dyer
A rebellious college-aged Jew discovers her best friend is the descendent of a golem; the story is more compelling if readers are
familiar with the myth.

#### "Popeye and Pops Watch the Evening World Report" by Eliot Fintushel
An alien and his compatriot melt into the television on a path toward home; the obtuse writing made this story a chore.

### Poetry

#### "Dodoes" by Steven Utley
Describes (poetically, I guess?) some of the reasons dodoes are extinct, then briefly mourns them.

## Volume 20, Issue 5 (May 1996)

### Departments

#### "Reflections: The Dinosaur in the Living Room" by Robert Silverberg
Silverberg reminisces about a trip to Scotland during which his wife convinces him to purchase a fossilized dinosaur skeleton.

### Short Stories

#### "The Goddess is Alive and, Well, Living in New York City" by Leslie What
Greek gods are dressed as civilians in an American country-western bar, and one seems to be cheating on the other (I don't really know because I didn't finish it); this reads like something by someone in junior high school who wore chunky jewelry and carried folders bearing unicorns and fairies (the pen name says it all).

#### "A Slurian Tale" by Steven Utley
A marine biologist who routinely travels through time to examine the evolution of various aquatic lifeforms is prone to telling tall tales about his findings; the story is a transparent attempt at commenting on the power of scientific narrative to excite the imagination.

### Novella

#### "Time Travelers Never Die" by Jack McDevitt
A pair of best friends experiments with time travel in an otherwise ordinary universe (the characters have emotions\!), when one of them dies mysteriously and, of course, creates a paradox the other must undo; this novella saved an otherwise laughable issue of the magazine.

## Volume 22, Issue 4 (April 1998)

### Short Stories

#### "The Year of the Mouse" by Norman Spinrad
Two cultures collide in a brief tale of businessmen negotiating intellectual property rights; while never named, Disney is depicted here as a ruthless, irreverent profiteer using an arsenal of technological, economic and ideological battering rams to enter new markets and further its agenda abroad.

### Novelettes

#### "Steamship Soldier on the Information Front" by Nancy Kress
In this tightly written piece of speculative fiction, a venture capitalist travels the globe to examine projects vying for funding; he manages work, life, home, family, and love using a tablet computer (an iPad ten years in the making) and his necktie.

## Volume 22, Issue 5 (May 1998)

### Short Stories

#### "Wild Minds" by Michael Swanwick
In this future, neural implants--which "optimize" human neural functioning--are the norm; the protagonist refuses to install one, however, and becomes socially and emotionally isolated as a result.

### Novelettes

#### "Lemuria Will Rise\!" by Kage Baker
A time-traveling botanist discovers a hermit with knowledge of technologies hundreds of years before their recorded appearances; he's stockpiling them so he can open a university in the great sunken city of Lemuria--when it rises from the sea (Kate loves the story's title).

#### "Crucifixion Variations" by Lawrence Person
A university bureaucrat tells of his partnership with an evangelical scientist tasked with proving the existence of Jesus using time-tracking technologies; unfortunately, while he can confirm the life of the son of God, he cannot verify the resurrection--a failing that rocks his faith and threatens to undo him.

#### "Wading River Dogs and More" by Michael Kandel
This incredibly moving and expertly written story of alien contact unfolds through a narrative relayed by its simple-minded protagonist, whose capacity for empathy with nonhuman entities makes him an incredible asset to science.

### Poetry

#### "Waiting for the Grief Fairy" by W. Gregory Stewart
A few simple lines capture the feeling of going to sleep and waking with worry in one's heart.

## Volume 35, Issue 1 (January 2011)

### Departments

#### "Interloper" by Ian McHugh
A band of nomads masquerades as a traveling circus as it travels between shanty towns dotting a post-apocalyptic landscape; the story would be enjoyable if it were just a tab less obtuse.

### Poetry

#### "Five Pounds of Sunlight" by Geoffrey A. Landis
Such a beautiful poem about movement, scale, and the interconnectedness of the universe and its bodies.

#### "Retired Spaceman" by G. O. Clark
A pensive and melancholy poem with an ironic title; the spaceman doesn't so much retire as fail to reach his goal of going into outer space.

## Volume 36, Issue 1 (January 2012)

### Departments

Two close sisters struggle against the robotic enforcers of their farming community's stringent population regulations.

#### "Over There" by Will McIntosh

#### "The Legend of Troop 13" by Kit Reed
A stargazing tour company warns observatory visitors of local lore about a runaway girl scout troop gone Lord-of-the-Flies; told from multiple perspectives, this story is easily the best of the issue.

## Volume 40, Issue 12 (December 2016)

### Departments

### Novella

#### "Where There Is Nothing, There Is God" by David Erik Nelson
An out-of-work, young theater graduate from UNC gets work time-traveling to a colonial town and posing as an emissary of God who demands offerings in the form of rare, historical artifacts; the meth he brings with him certainly greases the wheels a bit.

### Short Stories

#### "How the Damned Live On" by James Sallis
A young girl speaks daily with her giant spider friend (whose name is unpronounceable) on an island purgatory; I wanted more, but the punchline about sleeping and waking, linear and non-linear time, is moving enough.

#### "The Cold Side of the Island" by Kali Wallace
A twenty-something daughter returns to her hometown for the funeral of a childhood friend, opening a metaphorical box of powerful memories and a literal box of otherworldly bones while there.
